# How to Use GraphQL with Ruby on Rails - Part 1

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs. The query language itself is universal and  not tied to any frontend or backend technology. This characteristic makes it a great choice for many frameworks or patterns you or your company might follow.
